# Hyperfolio - Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous files and apps abandoned or developed as secondary support. For example:
- Baton: abandoned early project, where we planned on creating from scratch a microsservices load balancer/manager (Rust + React webview).
- Web Crawler: fully functional web crawler and data miner, developed from scratch (no crawler frameworks/libraries dependencies) initally to crawl for datasets to feed to the EntiGraph tool and integrated on various R&D side projects (e.g. NetLang, Major Minors, Inclusive Courts, etc.).
- React Native: early mobile versions of the app, abandoned in favour of a proof-of-concept Rust version.
Etc.
